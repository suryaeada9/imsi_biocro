Friday Meeting:
- Justin  (Cro modeling)
- Scott (Math major + Computer Science)
- Stark (UofW)
- Surya
- Deepak (Assistant Prof at IIT Kharagpur)
- Yufeng (Post Doc at UIUC from February)
- Meghan (Assistant Prof at Environmental Engineering)
- Daniel (Rising Junior, Intern (physics major))
-  Terrence (Rising Senior, Intern (Biology major))
- Seldon (PhD grad at Justin's lab, Chemistry and Molecular Engineering)
- Toyosi (McGraths lab, Botany, Biocro  modeling)
- Ed Lochoski (Post Doc for 2 years, ex-physicist)

Agendas: to keep track of the update.
- Surya and Stark will be working on quantitative
skill measures. Model quality can also be then written in papers.
- Daniel will work on how light can be driven through canopy for photosynthesis
Terrence will be working on soybean development model. will do comparisons of
model and reparameterize.
- Toyosi is going to work on nitrogen distribution through the canopy. how much is going through seeds.
(similar to carbon allocation but with nitrogen). Modeling transporters and all. (Nitrogen Partitioning
similar to carbon partitioning? deltac?)

Agenda document: got access.
- Ed Lochoski: I have a theory that "Cro" comes from "Gro" in "C", and
"Gro" is just commonly used in growth models because in the ancient days,
there weren't enough characters to write "Grow".

- BioCro "Gro_Solver" renaming
- Marketing of Biocro

- Orientation on github::page
- Ed to send a vignette
- There is a building the vignette
- https://ebimodeling.github.io/biocro-documentation/




https://www.ecosia.org/
R package:  Description, NameSpace, and License, src directory for other languages.
thermal_linear.h is an easy example with documentation.


- One function - Gro_Solver and run the models and finding a skill measure.
- weather05 or some other dataset suggestion from Ed
- Meeting on Monday to start work.
