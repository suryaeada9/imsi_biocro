Yield - Mass of what you care about/ ground area

- MAE, MAPE,  chi-square value, as measures of quality.
- weather data, yield at the end of year, (masses at many times of stems, leaves).

- direction of leaves, etc.... how much light goes to the canopy. used in a photosynthetic model
  photosynthetic rate of piece to rate of  entire canopy. (simulation is done).

- How much better is that model than the other? (utilization model vs partitioning model)


List of crops:
soybean -  grain
casava - root

myscanthus - stems and leaves
sorghum - stems and leaves

willow - whole tree
corn -  grain

5 times per year. Leaf Area Index - 15 times for 1000 times. There is also weather
 data. Take a look at the data and intro to biocro.

When do we meet again? - Wednesday 2 PM EST or 1 PM CST. Look over tutorial and
intro. Also find what Noah is doing?
